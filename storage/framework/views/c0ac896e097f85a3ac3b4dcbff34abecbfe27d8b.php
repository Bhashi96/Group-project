The Tourism Vancouver Island team has come together to discuss and formalize a set of consensus core values that define the positive, proactive nature and worldview of both the organization itself and its employees. 

“The Tourism Vancouver Island team has made the commitment to live and work with honesty and sincerity. We stand behind our word and honour any commitments we make. We are consistent in our decisions while recognizing that to be fair we must be flexible. We are ethical and respectful of ourselves and others.”
